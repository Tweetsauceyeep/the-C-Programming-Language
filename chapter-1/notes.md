#### Character Input and Outupt
- text streams: sequence of chars divided into lines; each line consisting of zero or more characters followed by a newline character

functions: 
- getchar() - reads next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. 
- putchar(c) prints a character each time it is called
    - prints the contents of the integer variable c as a character

*question*: Why is state represented by 0 and 1?
- idk ngl
