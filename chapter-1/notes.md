### Chapter 1: Notes

#### Character Input and Outupt
- text streams: sequence of chars divided into lines; each line consisting of zero or more characters followed by a newline character

functions: 
- getchar() - reads next input character from a text stream and returns that as its value. 
- putchar(c) prints a character each time it is called
    - prints the contents of the integer variable c as a character

*question*: Why is state represented by 0 and 1?
- idk ngl

changed book to C programming: a modern approach cuz like im rusty

# C Programming: a Modern Approach

### Compiling and Linking:
3 steps are involved in making a program ready to be run.

- *Preprocessing*:
    - Something like an editor, adds things to the program and make modifications
- *Compiling*:
    - THe modified program goes to a compiler, translating it into machine instructions (object code)
- *Linking*:
    - combines object code produced by the compiler
